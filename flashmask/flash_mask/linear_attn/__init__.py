# flash-linear-attention Paddle migration entry point
#
# Migrated from fla-org/flash-linear-attention (MIT License) for PaddlePaddle.
# Provides Triton-based GDN (Gated Delta Networks) and KDA (Kimi Delta
# Attention) operators with chunk-wise and fused-recurrent execution modes.
#
# Known limitations (Phase 1):
#   - Context Parallel (CP) is NOT supported.  The cp_context parameter is
#     accepted for API compatibility but has no effect; passing a non-None
#     value may raise NotImplementedError in backward paths.
#   - fused_recurrent_gdn / fused_recurrent_kda are FORWARD-ONLY.  Calling
#     backward through them will raise NotImplementedError.  Use the
#     chunk-based variants (chunk_gdn / chunk_kda) for training workloads
#     that require gradient computation.
